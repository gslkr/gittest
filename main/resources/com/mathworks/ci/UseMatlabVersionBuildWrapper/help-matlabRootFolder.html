  Enter the full path to the MATLAB root folder, which is returned by the <b>matlabroot</b> function. The plugin prepends the folder to the PATH environment variable and uses the specified MATLAB version to perform the build.
  You must not leave this box blank if no MATLAB folder exists on the path. If you leave it blank, the plugin attempts to use the topmost MATLAB folder on the system path.
  <br><br><br>Here are examples of the root folder path on different platforms:<br><br><b>Windows:</b><br> C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2020b <br>
  <b>Linux:</b><br> /usr/local/MATLAB/R2020b <br>
  <b>macOS:</b><br> /Applications/MATLAB_R2020b.app <br>
  <p>
  <b>Note:</b> If the job runs on a remote agent, you must specify the full path to MATLAB root folder on the remote agent.</p>
